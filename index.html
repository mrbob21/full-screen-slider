                <p>By collecting 1252 clothes and 165 pairs of shoes, through Soles4Souls, 
                    we created $1493.25 of economic opportunity for families and communities
                    around the world through 4Opportunity and 4Relief programs. 
                    We also diverted 706.25 pounds of waste from going to local landfills,
                    and our service was worth 8 hours total. In developing countries like Haiti and Honduras,
                    our donations provided consistent quality food, housing and education for 3 years. </p>
